excerpt: 'This paper presents the potential of integrating visual analytics into the analysis process for web security studies, in order to make this process more efficient.'
abstract: 'The growing impact of issues in web security has led researchers to conduct large-scale measurements aimed at analyzing and understanding web-related ecosystems. Comprehensive solutions for data collection on a large set of websites have been developed, but analysis practices remain ad hoc, requiring additional efforts and slowing down investigations. A promising approach to data analysis is visual analytics, where interactive visualizations are used to speed up data exploration. However, this approach has not yet been applied to web security, and creating such a solution requires addressing domain-specific challenges. In this paper, we show how visual analytics can help in analyzing the data from web security studies. We present a case study of leveraging an interactive visualization tool to replicate a security study, and evaluate a prototype tool implementing visual analytics techniques designed for web security. We conclude that such a tool would provide a solution that allows researchers to more effectively study web security issues.'
