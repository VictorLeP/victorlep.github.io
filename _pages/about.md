Welcome! I am a PhD student in the area of web security, under the supervision of prof. Wouter Joosen and [Tom Van Goethem](https://tom.vg). My interests lie in the exploration of web ecosystems, and in web security research metholodogy, both analyzing and improving current methods. I hold a PhD fellowship of the [Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO)](https://www.fwo.be/).

You can take a look at my [publications](/publications). 

You might also be interested in the [Tranco ranking](https://tranco-list.eu/), which we propose as a more suitable replacement for the Alexa top 1 million list, as this list is very unstable and can easily be manipulated.
